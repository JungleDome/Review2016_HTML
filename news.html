				<h1>Ostrich On The ROAD!!</h1>
				<p>President Trump recently tried to ban anyone from a list of seven Muslim-majority countries from coming into the United States. The Ninth Circuit Court has thwarted those efforts so far, though Trump plans to appeal that decision. Meanwhile, many legal citizens, green-card holders and even those born here have faced scrutiny at the border. And here in Silicon Valley, that ban and other efforts against immigrants have a greater impact on tech and the economy. Immigrants have been instrumental in building some of the world’s largest tech companies and Silicon Valley feeds on a constant flow of brain power and innovation from people coming from all over the world. However, Trump is expected to soon take steps to overhaul the rules for the H-1B visa program, a specialized type of visa given to highly skilled workers, nearly half of which go to those working in Silicon Valley. Both fears of a Muslim ban and the possibility skilled workers may face a denial of entry looms large in the Valley, dashing hopes for those wanting to contribute in the innovation capital.</p>
