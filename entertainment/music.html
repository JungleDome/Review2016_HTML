						This is a sore lovely song. This song expresses the feeling of exclamation 
						for the pass by of love. The irreducible soreness and self-murmuring bring 
						the feeling of hate which is following the screaming and vanished in the soreness. 
						Heart-breaking but not feeling pain, smiling but not happy, in the moment of tear stop 
						failing, these all you did.
