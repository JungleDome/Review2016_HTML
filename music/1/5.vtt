We don't love anymore

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.050 align:middle line:84%
What was all of it for

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.870 align:middle line:84%
Oh we don't talk anymore like we used to do

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.450 align:middle line:84%
I just heard you found the one you've been looking

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.860 align:middle line:90%
You've been looking for
[00:29.35]

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.530 align:middle line:84%
I wish I would have known that wasn't me

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.060 align:middle line:90%
'Cause even after all this time I still wonder
[00:36.18]

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.430 align:middle line:90%
Why I can't move on
[00:38.99]

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.440 align:middle line:90%
Just the way you did so easily
[00:42.57]

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.180 align:middle line:84%
Don't wanna know

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.530 align:middle line:84%
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.060 align:middle line:84%
If he's holding onto you so tight

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.040 align:middle line:90%
The way I did before
[00:52.23]

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.740 align:middle line:84%
I overdosed

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.120 align:middle line:84%
Should've known your love was a game

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.500 align:middle line:84%
Now I can't get you out of my brain

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.090 align:middle line:84%
Oh it's such a shame

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.000 align:middle line:84%

Selena£ºI just hope you're lying next to somebody

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.380 align:middle line:84%
Who knows how to love you like me

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.100 align:middle line:84%
There must be a good reason that you're gone

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.480 align:middle line:84%
Every now and then I think you

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.970 align:middle line:90%
Might want me to come show up at your door
[01:36.45]

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.010 align:middle line:84%
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.790 align:middle line:84%
Don't wanna know

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.150 align:middle line:84%
If you're looking into her eyes

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.580 align:middle line:84%
If she's holding onto you so tight the way I did before

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.340 align:middle line:84%
I overdosed

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.710 align:middle line:84%
