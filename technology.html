				P90D is manufactured with autopilot technology in which the car can be 
				functioning and keep working without needing a driver. This model is equipped with high advanced sensors which can keep safe distance between cars. The car will moderate the speed by 
				itself which accelerates the speed when there is a long distance between it and car that is in front of it and vice versa. .
				</p>
				<p>
				P90D even notices the situation which needing to brake. The transition from cruising at 90mph to dead stop is extremely smooth. The car hauled itself down with a combo of regenerative 
				braking and actual-for-real braking, coming to a halt about a meter behind the stopped car in front of it. The brake interval can be set by users to produce smaller inertia as possible. 
				</p>
				<p>
				When there is a curve on road, the car will decelerate the speed and accelerate smoothly back out the turn if car is going very fast to negotiate the curve. If users want to change the lane, 
				all the things need to do is just triggering the left or right signal. The car will check the lane that users want to switch into is not be occupied and accelerate slightly then make the change.
				</p>
				<p>
				For security, the car will alert users if users remove their hands from wheel for about 90 seconds. The car will sound alert tone and display dialog on center console to remind users to grasp 
				the wheel. If users ignore the alert, the car will disengage the auto-cruise and auto-steer and finally slow to stop. The car with autopilot technology is to be trusted that car accidents can 
				be avoided completely compared to driving car manually.

				<h1>Eternal Data Storage</h1>
				<p style="color:white; text-align:center">
				Using nanostructured glass, scientists from the University’s Optoelectronics Research Centre (ORC) have developed the recording and retrieval processes of five dimensional (5D) digital 
				data by femtosecond laser writing. The technology was first experimentally demonstrated in 2013 when a 300 kb digital copy of a text file was successfully recorded in 5D.

				At University of Southampton, scientists successfully develop “Superman crystal” which accomplish the request for high-density immutable storage. The glass disc has capability to 
				store up to 360TB of data and able to last almost forever at room temperature. 
				</p>
				<p>
				A femtosecond laser delivers ultrashort light pulses onto a piece of quartz, creating microscopic dots which are nano-grantings in the quartz to record data. Each dot encodes 3 bit 
				of information such as dot position, intensity and polarization of light in three layers of quartz. The scientists behind this innovation increases the storage capacity by adding 
				additional polarization states and importance improvements to write times.
				</p>
				<p>
				The self-assembled nanostructures change the way light travels through glass by modifying polarization of light that can then be read by combination of optical microscope and a polariser. 
				This concept is similar to that found in Polaroid sunglasses.
				</p>
				<p>
				The Southampton team is still actively looking for industry partners to commercialize the new technology. The use of nano-structured glass data storage is expected to be approached to national 
				archives, museums, and libraries. They have already saved versions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Newton’s Opticks, the Magna Carta as well as the King James Bible in 5D storage, 
				and the possibilities for other kinds of data storage and sharing are quite literally limitless. Any data stored to these disks will outlast us all.

				Google Home which is AI product designed by Google and released on 4 November 2016 capable to tell users the latest news and weather, keep track of appointment, control smart home as 
				well as playing music. The top angled of device is touch sensitive surface which can be used to change the volume, start a request, play or pause music and turn off alarm or timer. 
				Instead of controlling the Home by touching its surface, users can command the Home with their voice. Home is able to get knowing users’ thought. For example, when you are saying 
				that you need a coat, Home will tell you the current weather report. Home is designed for personal usage which can only allow one account linked at a time.

				With AI technology, machine learning is introduced which computer will learn how to do tasks such as image recognition and text translation by itself without needing programmer to teach it. 
				Google DeepMind’s AI program, Alpha Go used machine learning to defeat human opponent. Deep learning which builds complex mathematical structure called neural network based on cast quantities 
				of data is the most powerful form of machine learning being used today. TensorFlow is an open-source software suit introduced by Google which is used by the researches to understand the powerful 
				models they create. Google is also supporting the highly success of Keras whereas Facebook is supporting the development of 2 Deep Learning frameworks such as Torch and Caffe. Neural network-based 
				machine learning will instead prove to be a technology like any other, useful in some areas, useless in others, and eventually doomed to be rendered obsolete in turn by a future innovation.
				</p>
				<p>
				AI is going to help us to reduce the error in order to increase the possibility of reaching higher accuracy. AI also facilitates the exploration in all fields. Since they are machine-body which have 
				more resistant and able to endure the space and hostile atmosphere, they can be used in mining and fuels exploration process. Moreover, the complex machines can be used in exploring the ocean floor 
				which overcomes the limitation of human.

				As we know that, AI plays important role in assisting our daily life. When taking a picture, the algorithm of AI detects and determines the face of people. Besides, it also functions to tag the 
				individuals when we are posting photographs on the social media sites such as Facebook, Instagram and Weibo. As AI is programmed which does not have any emotion. AI can think more logical and make 
				precise decision compared to human because they are not affected by emotional factor.

				The time is changed. Blockchain is underlying the use of bitcoin and has the ability of having permanent records transaction and allowing people to view the changes online in real time. 
				Digital signatures, signed blocks of transactions and distributed shared ledger are the three useful elements included in blockchain. With digital signatures, the possession of private key, 
				message resources and modifications of message are able to be verified as well as allowing fine-grained version control of documents and contracts. Preserving the sequences of transaction, 
				allowing fine-grained access control at the level of transaction and creating continually updated audit traits are the popular functions performed by signed transaction blocks. Since blockchain 
				acts as distributed, shared ledger, a single version of transaction truth can be established easily. Furthermore, blockchain also exposes to the autonomous agents, processes and organizations 
				implied by smart contract technology.
				</p>
				<p>
				Blockchain facilitates the transfer from property rights to stocks and currencies without the need of third party while offering safety, higher speed and lower costs. This can approach to disintermediation 
				and trustless exchange and strongly reduce counterparty risk.
				</p>
				<p>
				The block validation system ensure nobody can tamper with records which can provide the highest security to all end users. Blockchain is also known as mutual distributed ledger (MDL) in 
				which blockchain is a kind of permanent database coexisting in multiple locations and shared by community. As blockchain is operating with decentralized networks, blockchain 
				is free from risk of losing data when experiencing failure as a central point and malicious attacks. This provides benefits to all users in term of reliability, longevity and durability.
				</p>
				<p>
				Many different financial institutes put their high credibility to blockchain due to its high reputation. With blockchain, banks can increase their efficiency in managing transactions. By 2027, 
				about 10 percent of entire global GPD will be stored in blockchains.

				Dubbed Wi-Fi which is a technology of University of Washington is being commercialized. This technology enables battery-free gadgets connected with conventional devices by backscattering Wi-Fi signals. The 
				prototype passive Wi-Fi devices have beamed data as far as 100 feet and made connections through walls. Passive Wi-Fi just 1/10000th as much power as existing Wi-Fi to communicate. For instance, security camera 
				could power its other circuits b using energy harvested from Wi-Fi signals it is backscattering or by feeding on other signals including TV and radio broadcast. Researchers believed that tiny passive Wi-Fi devices 
				could be very cheap to make in which less than a dollar.

				<p>
				With wireless power transmission system, the existing high-tension power transmission line cables, towers and substations between the generating station and customers will be no longer required. The wireless power 
				transmission system facilitates the interconnection of electrical generation plants on global scale. Moreover, the electric energy cost for customers will be reduced as the cost of transmission and distribution become less.
